        <p>Peace is a state of calm and harmony where people live without fear, violence, or conflict. It allows individuals and communities to grow, work together, and solve problems through understanding and respect. True peace is not just the absence of war, but also the presence of justice, kindness, and equal opportunities for all.</p>
